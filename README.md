# Charity Website

Back-End jump with Django/August 2023

## 📌 Introduction

We have been asked to implement a website for charities so that charity related matters can be done more easily.

## 🎯 Goals

 1. Benefactors ,those in need and charities should be able to create user accounts for themselves.
 2. Charities and people in need should be able to create a charity request.
 3. Benevolent people should be able to apply for charity work and if this request is accepted, it should be left to them.
 4. It should be possible to register charity affairs with detailed details and implementation phase.
 5. The possibility of changing contracts.
 6. Admin panel with the ability to monitor things.
